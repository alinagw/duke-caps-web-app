Try creating a few routines, such as where you take breaks, where you exercise, etc. Also, make your living space uniquely comfortable, both reminding you of home and also pointing you toward your future. Once you’ve done this, that new familiarity can replace the homesickness because you’ll find that, at Duke, you are also at home.
