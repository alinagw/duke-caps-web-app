Often, they divide their days into ‘good' days when they have no desire to binge and ‘bad' days when the compulsion to binge becomes irresistible.  Before a person will be diagnosed with bulimia, she/he will have had at least an average of two binge-eating episodes a week for at least three months, and she/he will have experienced these eating episodes as uncontrollable (unable to stop even though she/he knows it's excessive eating). Additionally, a person struggling with bulimia regularly engages in either strict dieting (or simply not eating), excessive exercising between these binges episodes, self-induced vomiting, and/or use of  laxatives and diuretics to lose weight. All of these behaviors operate under a persistent concern with body shape and weight. Because of the awareness that these binge episodes are not normal, there is typically a great deal of shame that leads to keeping the difficulty a secret.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <h4>Disordered Eating Which Does Not Meet Diagnostic Criteria</h4>\n                <p>Perhaps the single most important thing to keep in mind about the diagnoses of disordered eating is that anyone who is struggling to a degree that does not meet the criteria for a specific eating disorder is in a struggle that is as legitimate as any diagnosis could ever be.  Diagnostic criteria are constantly changing as mental health professionals learn more and more about the struggles we all face, and they are still learning about disordered eating.  Therefore, diagnostic criteria and terminology may also change. For example, there is a condition referred to as Binge Eating Disorder still undergoing research before being included as a formal diagnosis.  Binge Eating Disorder involves uncontrollable eating episodes but does not consistently involve a behavior to compensate.  This struggle impacts a great many people, a significant number of whom struggle with obesity.  These individuals often seek help  toward weight loss and the underlying issues leading to the frequent binges are not attended to because they’re not thought of has having disordered eating.</p>\n                <p>Many individuals suffer from some level or type of eating behavior that is disrupting their lives.  They are struggling with a confusing problem that feels both absurd and easy to fix but carries an intensity and a depth that makes it hard to place aside.  For some, disordered eating is about a different kind of hunger… and for others, it’s about a painful sense of being too full of some of life’s vulnerabilities.  For others, it’s both.  Either way, the difficulty is real and the availability of help is there.</p>\n                <br>\n                <p><i>© 2001. LifeShops. Gary D.
