As believers in every human being’s potential for healing and growth, we hold firm to the values of inclusion, multicultural diversity and social justice.

Just as reactions to controversial events vary across campus, they also vary among the CAPS staff.   We are each uniquely affected and respond with an array of complex emotions and viewpoints. At the same time, we strive to understand and respect perspectives that may be different from our own. Therefore, we join voices in making this pledge to all Duke students: your perspectives, values, and experiences will be welcome at CAPS, you will be safe, you will be respected, and you will be heard.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      We want to remind you that you are not alone and that there are a variety of services available to support you through arduous times.  We applaud the tireless efforts of campus organizations, student groups, and committed individuals who provide spaces for discussion of all forms of inequality at our university and in our world.  We invite students to access these many resources.  We also invite you to reach out to CAPS as needed for emergency walk-in appointments, individual or group counseling, or tailored outreach programs by request.\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>\n      As actions of hatred, threats of violence, and expressions fo disrespect continue to occur on campus (and beyond), CAPS stands by all communities that suffer from the racism, sexism, islamaphobia, and assaults on communities that reflect our sexual and gender diversity!
