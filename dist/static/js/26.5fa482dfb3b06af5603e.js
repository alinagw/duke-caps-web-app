Another defining feature of a binge is that the eating is experienced as out of the person's control.

Once the eating begins, however, and during the anticipation of the episode, the inevitable and uncontrollable sensation still occurs.   If, for some reason the planned binge cannot occur (somebody stops by, for example), the urge becomes complicated by a lot of nervousness.   Immediately following the binge, there is a period of relief or even of feeling intensely satisfied.  However, this is typically followed by strong shame and feeling disgusted with one's self.   Because of this shame reaction, there is a wish and full intention to never behave in this manner again.  However, much of the binging is a reaction to a troubled self-image, so this reaction may actually play a role in the next binge occurring.

It may make sense to view it as an illness because it helps to emphasize how important it is to get help to overcome it.

The person with anorexia or similar difficulties is extremely focused on a pursuit of thinness.   She (or he) is intensely afraid of gaining weight.

Yet, we don't meet the criteria for a bulimia diagnosis. The difference between those of us with such common excessive-eating episodes and someone who has bulimia nervosa is that the latter binge-eat frequently (more than twice a week) and have lost control over their eating behaviors. For them, what we experience on occasion is more of an ongoing struggle.  Their lives typically begin to revolve around concerns about food. Often, they divide their days into ‘good' days when they have no desire to binge and ‘bad' days when the compulsion to binge becomes irresistible.  Before a person will be diagnosed with bulimia, she/he will have had at least an average of two binge-eating episodes a week for at least three months, and she/he will have experienced these eating episodes as uncontrollable (unable to stop even though she/he knows it's excessive eating). Additionally, a person struggling with bulimia regularly engages in either strict dieting (or simply not eating), excessive exercising between these binges episodes, self-induced vomiting, and/or use of  laxatives and diuretics to lose weight.
