However, as you'll see with the other elements of a conflict, the Facts and Situations are not enough to determine what will occur in the conflict.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <h4>Points of View and Frames of Reference</h4>\n                <p>For each person in the conflict, it isn't that one is necessarily correct and the other wrong; it may be that different points of view have access to different facts and situations, informing what each person actually sees.  For example, imagine a guy being very secretive about where he is going one afternoon and his partner sensing that he's lying. From the partner's point of view, dishonesty is taking place. However, from the guy's point of view, he is planning a surprise party for his partner. A conflict could easily emerge between these two who see the same things but view them very differently.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <h4>Beliefs and Opinions</h4>\n                <p>Each person in the conflict carries beliefs and opinions about what is happening.   These represent the different ways individuals assign meaning to the facts and situations of a conflict.  For example, a magazine left on a table can mean a relaxed atmosphere to one person and an inconsiderate act of messiness to another. This is the element that most often drives the conflicts. People carry different underlying assumptions about what things mean, and these are the things that conflict brings to the surface. In productive conflicts, this is where much learning can take place, enabling the partners to say things such as, \"I learned what this means to you\" or \"I realized how strongly you feel about that.\"</p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Not Taking Out the Trash is Bad.</li>\n                    <li>Coming home 20 minutes late without calling is not such a big deal.</li>\n                    <li>Playing music loud is the ONLY way to fully appreciate it.</li>\n                </ul>\n                <h4><i>When beliefs and opinions are learned, then the information needed in order to respect each other is available.</i></h4>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <h4>Emotion</h4>\n                <p>Finally, closely linked to the Beliefs and Opinions about the issues at hand, the final element of any conflict is the Emotion. The Emotion element is usually the one that carries the vulnerability inherent in relationships, not to mention the vulnerability that usually has many individuals avoiding conflict whenever possible. There are two contexts of Emotion in any conflict.</p>\n                <p><b>First,</b> there are the emotions about the issue at hand---the love, anger, fear, confusion, sadness, and disappointment that one feels when something of value is treated in a way that hurts enough to start a conflict.</p>\n                <p><b>Second,</b> there are all the emotions that surface about the fact that a conflict is occurring. Conflict is usually uncomfortable for most people, and it introduces a scary possibility that the relationship might be harmed (not unlike the fear that you will hammer your thumb instead of the nail when building something).</p>\n                <p>There are a lot of feelings about having a conflict that also impact how the conflict will progress, and it is important to be aware of your emotions so that you can recognize when they influence what you say and do.<br></p>\n                <p><i>© 2001.

In order to increase the chances for a productive conflict climate, there are various things to consider:</p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Conflict is a matter of differing perspectives</li>\n                    <li>The goal is not for one partner to win but for the relationship to win</li>\n                    <li>You can develop and use various skills to make your conflict as productive and instructive as possible.</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <h4>Perspectives Change Perceptions</h4>\n                <p>An important factor to consider is that shifting one’s point of view can change the way one views the issue. Ask yourself,</p>\n                <p><i>\"If I thought about this from her (his) point of view, would I still agree with myself?\"</i></p>\n                <p>This is a healthy and productive stance to take. This doesn’t mean that you should surrender your own position.  It is important, however, to recognize that another perspective may be as valid as your own.  Consider an argument about keeping the living space neat and straightening things out when the living space becomes messy.  You may both actually agree on this goal.  \"Let's not allow our place to become messy!\" However, to one person, the place is a mess when there are dirty dishes from the night before on the counters, gym clothes on the couch, books and papers from a research project someone is working on, and a pile of CD's on top of the stereo from a party this past weekend. Yet, for another person, a single book bag on the recliner and a magazine on the chair instead of the magazine rack next to the chair constitutes a mess. A healthy conflict in this scenario would involve escaping from a struggle about whether the apartment is messy to one that concludes,</p>\n                <p><i>\"I need to remember that when the apartment is this messy, it really bothers my roommate and I want to avoid bothering him because I like my roommate.  I'll try to clean up after myself more than if I was just living alone.\"</i>, and</p>\n                <p><i>\"I need to remember that it takes much more stuff lying around for my roommate to view it being such a mess than it does for me, and he is not being inconsiderate, necessarily.  He simply hasn't been triggered yet to clean the place up.  I’ll keep in mind not to take it personally when she doesn’t clean up as quickly as I would.\"</i></p>\n                <p>Of course, having a dialogue and coming to some middle ground will help the relationship.  Therefore, if a conflict leads to such a dialogue, this would be an example of a healthy productive conflict.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <h4>My Needs and Our Needs</h4>\n                <p>Most people think of a conflict or argument as something that one person wins and the other person loses.  However, it is possible to win an argument and still damage the relationship.  An important factor in any conflict is that there are three parties for every two people in conflict:</p>\n                <ol>\n                    <li>The first person</li>\n                    <li>The second person</li>\n                    <li>The relationship they share</li>\n                </ol>\n                <p>It is easy to think of conflict in terms of ”me against you”. This will likely lead to someone winning and someone losing. This means someone losing a sense of personal power or respect. Another way to look at the conflict is in terms of “us against this disagreement”, so that the winners are all the people involved and the \"loser\" is the issue that threatens to harm the relationship.</p>\n                <p>Consider an argument in a romantic couple in which the first partner wants to go out and spend time together tonight and the other partner asserts the need to stay home and study. Clearly, the partner who needs to study has a legitimate argument: being a responsible college student means “I need to study!”  However, if this partner has been neglecting the other a lot lately, it's critical that the impact of not studying be weighed against the consequences of not spending time with the partner. Conversely, if the partner asserting the need to study had actually been spending so much time with the other partner that his/her grades have suffered, it's critical to assess the impact of giving in now on academic survival. A healthy conflict in this scenario would involve having each person shifting away from “getting his or her way” to how this decision will impact each of them and the relationship they share.</p>\n                <p><i>\"I really do need to study tonight, but I realize that I've been putting my school, my family, and my friends first a lot lately, and my partner hasn't really felt connected to me. The truth is, I love my partner and don't want this relationship to ever feel this disconnected for either of us, so I'll just have to make studying the top priority tomorrow because the relationship is in greater distress than my grades are right now.\"</i>, and </p>\n                <p><i>\"We've actually been spending a lot of time together lately, and I love being together. But I haven't been doing what I need to do for myself at all, including studying ---and this is a big exam. If I fail this exam, I'm really going to resent this relationship and my partner. So, the best thing for me and this relationship is that I assert my own need right now and we'll have fun again this weekend.\"</i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <h4>Power and Control Issues</h4>\n                <p>Conflict can easily evolve into a struggle to see who has more power or control in the relationship.   In fact, the outcome of a conflict is often determined by who is the more powerful person rather than what is best for the relationship. Therefore, for healthy and productive conflict, it is important to consider not only Personal Power but also Relationship Power. Two issues are always at play during conflict:</p>\n                <ol>\n                    <li>The issue the conflict is about, and</li>\n                    <li>The sense of personal power or respect that each person holds, creates, or loses as a result of the conflict.</li>\n                </ol>\n                <p>Ending a conflict with the goal that each person feels their position was respected and understood, regardless of the outcome of the conflict, is a critical ingredient in productive and healthy conflict. It is often difficult to determine what is most important. What’s best for me? What’s best for you? What’s best for us? If conflict is going to be used as a tool to improve the relationship, compromising will have to occur. Some important questions to consider when deciding when and how to compromise include:</p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Is one person giving in much more than the other?</li>\n                    <li>Does giving in again cost you dignity or respect?</li>\n                    <li>Does holding your ground cause the other person to view you as insensitive to their needs?</li>\n                    <li>What is the conflict about?</li>\n                    <li>Is there a hidden conflict underneath the conflict? If so.Is there something more important than the actual issue you’re in conflict about, such as the other person’s self esteem, the overall need for a balance of control in the relationship, or your own sense of being respected as an individual?</li>\n                </ul>\n                <br>\n                <p><i>© 2001.
