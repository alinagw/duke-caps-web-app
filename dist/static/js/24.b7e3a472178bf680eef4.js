Once acknowledged, emotions are more likely to simply just \"be there\" rather than \"taking over\" making your words come out wrong or getting in the way of your first priority: communicating that you want to help. Another advantage of beginning by sharing your feelings is that she/he is likely feeling quite a storm of emotions also.   But she/he may not have named them as such.  By you saying what you are feeling, the person struggling will be more likely to say, “I feel that way, too” or at least say “I’m feeling a lot, too”.  This leads to the most important advantage of expressing your emotions:  it centers emotions as the topic of the conversation rather than an impersonal and distressing eating disorder.Now that you have introduced the issue and set the stage by sharing the emotions that are being felt by everyone involved, what next?  Well, she or he may suspect that you are going to bring up the disordered eating because she or he has most likely been aware of it and struggling with this.

So, approaching with sensitivity and caring is critical.  Pay attention to whether she/he is becoming overwhelmed by the discussion.

It emphasizes that the problem is something “that really hurts inside.”  A person struggling with disordered eating is hurting inside and most likely hurting a great deal.

This is okay, and simply acknowledging tears with validating support-statements such as “I know this is really hard” or “I know this must really hurt inside” can be helpful. When you get to the point where you actually bring up the disordered eating behaviors, it’s important to focus on the behaviors as specifically as possible.

As highlighted throughout this page, it’s important to avoid talking about food and weight as much as possible.  Never force them or pressure a person struggling with disordered eating to eat.  Not only does this add to the already tumultuous struggle they experience, it likely will force them away from ever considering you as someone who understands.  Also, as tempting as it may be to share your perceptions of how thin or how attractive the person struggling with disordered eating is, it’s important to not base your support on your perceptions of their thinness or attractiveness.  Although it may seem like a logical thing to compliment a person for being attractive, several negative consequences are possible.  The most likely thing is that they won’t believe that you’re telling the truth.  It isn’t so much that the person thinks you are a liar, but more that you are just saying something untrue out of kindness.  Or, they may believe that you are telling the truth from your perspective, but that it’s an incorrect perception.  Finally, often a person hears a compliment such as “You’re so thin already!” or “I think you are the most attractive person I’ve ever met” and interpret this as an indication that the disordered eating behavior is successfully giving them what they so desperately strive for.  One of the central factors that helps to maintain disordered eating is that the person struggling reduces him or herself to extremely concrete dimensions.  To pay compliments about physical features, however well intentioned, can serve to reinforce the distorted self-perception that physical features are what defines the individual.  Compliments about intelligence, kindness, humor, unique ideas, and assertiveness are likely to remind the person struggling that there is so much more to her than the number they are measuring themselves by.")])]),_vm._v(" "),_c('div',[_c('h4',[_vm._v("Plant Seeds, Not Trees")]),_vm._v(" "),_c('p',[_vm._v("Helping individuals struggling with disordered eating can be an emotionally draining experience if you begin to measure yourself by the same tangible results that they likely measures themselves by.

Your job is to do what you are able to reduce the aloneness she or he experiences in her or his struggle.  You may want to see quick results.   You may even reach a point where you feel you need to see the person make some visible changes for the better.  This is a recipe for frustration and possibly conflict.  It may take a long time because it’s far more than just eating behaviors and attitudes that need to change for growth and healing to take place.  It’s about learning to think about things in life differently.  It’s about learning to develop trust, perhaps for the first time in her or his life.   Think of yourself as a planter of seeds.  When you plant seeds, it takes quite a while for things to show up above ground that testify that a seed was ever planted.  Your friend or loved one that is struggling with disordered eating is a magnificent living being with many dimensions and components; it will take time for the roots to be restored, for them to learn how to use the nourishment to develop into a trunk, then begin expanding into branches, then giving birth to leaves and blossoming flowers or fruits.
