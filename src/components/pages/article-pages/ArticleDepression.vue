					<p>The word has become so commonly used in our language, it is often difficult to know just how serious a person’s struggle may be.  At times, people distinguish between a "clinical depression" and the everyday term "depressed" which conveys feeling really down. This page is devoted to helping you understand both phenomena so you know best how to get support to those who may face depression, whether it's you or someone you know and care about.</p>

					<h2>What is Depression?</h2>
					<p>The word has become so commonly used in our language, it is often difficult to know just how serious a person’s struggle may be. At times, people distinguish between a "clinical depression" and the everyday term "depressed" which conveys feeling really down. This page is devoted to helping you understand both phenomena so you know best how to get support to those who may face depression, whether it's you or someone you know and care about.</p>
					<p>The term "clinical depression" is often used by people to describe a more serious condition, one, perhaps, that has been diagnosed by a mental health professional.  It's often an intimidating task to answer the question, "How Do I Know When It's That Serious?"  This page is intended to help you know the difference between a normal experience of feeling down and discouraged and an episode of depression.</p>
					<p>Some of the difference is a matter of degrees. Many psychological problems that carry a formal diagnosis are simply more extreme versions of our normal everyday problems. We all feel anxious from time to time. We all have experiences, sometimes, where we can't get certain thoughts or urges out of our head until we act on them. At times, most of us turn to external things (such as food or work or drugs or alcohol) to change that uncomfortable feeling inside that is hard to pin down.  We all feel down from time to time.And we all get shaken from our day to day responsibilities and interests from time to time. But sometimes, these storms and quakes of life impact us in a way that painful time seems to stand still, and we are unable to function as productive individuals motivated toward life. It's as if everything we are gets pressed down into a hard-to-define space that feels empty, heavy, and persistent. Different perspectives define depression differently: medical approaches define it as an illness while other approaches view it as a state of mind. Still others view depression as a condition comprised of psychological, social-context, and physiological components. Regardless of perspective, the evidence of depression is recognizable through the following signs:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Feelings of Intense and/or Persistent Sadness</li>
						<li>Increased Need for Sleep or Difficulty Sleeping</li>
						<li>A Noticeable Increase or Decrease in Appetite</li>
						<li>Suicidal Thoughts or Gestures</li>
						<li>Repeated Episodes of Uncontrollable or Spontaneous Crying</li>
						<li>Feelings of Hopelessness</li>
						<li>Feelings of Worthlessness</li>
						<li>Loss of Enjoyment from things that are Typically Enjoyable</li>
						<li>Difficulty Concentrating</li>
						<li>Noticeably More Irritable Moods</li>
						<li>Noticeable Decrease in Emotional and/or Physical Energy</li>
					</ul>
					<p>While it is most appropriate for a mental health professional to determine whether a person may meet the criteria to be diagnosed with Depression, if you or a loved one recognize several of these signs, persisting for longer than is normal for the struggling person, it would be a good idea to have that person see a mental health professional.   Whether the person can be formally assigned a diagnosis of Depression is not nearly as important as responding to the pain and disruption that these indicators represent.  Contacting CAPS is a good first step a person can take toward recovering his/her complete sense of who they are. For more information about Depression, click on the links below.</p>

					<h2>What Causes Depression?</h2>
					<p>A relatively common reaction that individuals have to struggling with depression is "I must be very weak!" A person’s background can have a significant impact on how he or she interprets a struggle with depression. Often, individuals who come from backgrounds characterized by financial security, caring and involved family members, and many social advantages prohibit themselves from ever struggling.  In such instances, there is usually strong condemnation of the self, with assertions such as  "I haven’t had anything horrible happen to me! I have no reason for getting depressed!"  Other times, when individuals have come from backgrounds with more daily struggles, there is an equally powerful mandate against being “weak”. A sense of “having come this far” or “representing success for a community that has struggled” makes it feel like a crime to struggle with depression. Nevertheless, struggling with depression usually has very little to do with how “weak” someone may be, by nature. In fact, most who do struggle with depression continue pressing on precisely because they have a great deal of strength.  Sometimes, however, strength is not defined by the absence of weakness but rather the resourcefulness of how to respond during some of the challenging times of life. </p>
					<p>There are actually various potential causes of depression, only some of which have anything to do with strength or weakness. Some causes seem to have more to do with physiology than anything else.  Others have to do with personal history. Finally, in some ways, it seems that conventional ideas about "being strong" may ironically contribute to a mindset that places one at risk for depression. Let’s examine these conceivable explanations for depression one at a time.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>Unresolved Difficulty and Pain</h4>
					<p>Perhaps the most easily understood explanation for depression is the most recognizable: a painful or difficult experience.  Death of a loved one, loss of a significant relationship, a difficult transition (from high school to college, for example), or a traumatic event (such as assault or an accident) can all precipitate a depressive episode. All of these examples of possible depression triggers are acute events. Difficulty and pain can also be experienced in a more ongoing fashion and lead to depression further down the road of life. For example, surviving any kinds of abuse throughout childhood and or adolescence can explain depression in college. Sexual molestation, verbal abuse by significant figures (parents, other authority figures, and/or peers), neglect or disregard from care-givers in childhood, all of these experiences are painful in ways that the sufferer needs to keep the pain inside and invisible in order to minimize the trauma. Then, in college, when the danger of being in more visible pain subsides, depression may emerge even when life seems to have improved tremendously. It’s almost as if the depression was put on hold.  Whether the difficulty or pain is recent or in the more distant personal history, counseling can be helpful at reexamining the way in which the painful experience continues to inform the person’s life-perspective. From this point forward, revising one’s perspective through counseling and, perhaps, improving the mood through medication, can lift the depressed person back to a satisfying life.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>Physiology and Biological Predisposition</h4>
					<p>Sometimes, depression is largely a physiological problem; in other words, it is as much a medical illness as diabetes in that the body does something different than it does in most bodies, resulting in the difficulties and danger we associate with such illnesses. A medical doctor, especially an M.D. with a specialty in Psychiatry, is the most appropriate source of information about the physiology of people with depression. As medical professionals learn more and more about how the "chemistry" of depression there are an increasing number of medical options that can be useful in helping reduce the difficulties caused by the depression.</p>
					<p>Research does show, rather clearly, that depression is more likely to occur if there is a family history of depression. This may be an indication that there is a genetic link and that depression "runs in families".   It may also be explained by the fact that when a member of the family suffers from depression, especially if it is a parent, then the condition prevents that person from meeting the fundamental psychological needs of others in the family. This deprivation of psychological support also places them at risk for depression whether or not a genetic link actually exists. Regardless of the origin, what matters is that there are ways to attend to depression, and seeking the support may be the best first step while you are in college.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>Being "Strong"</h4>
					<p>Of course, being strong is not actually a risk factor for depression. However, many individuals live their lives as though it's absolutely forbidden to experience (much less display) any vulnerability. So guarded against being or appearing "weak", such individuals assume a facade of strength that essentially leaves their normal vulnerable and interdependent sides hidden and unattended to. Like children locked in a closet, the more complete version of the person living behind such facades of strength can become lonely, frightened, and. actually depressed. Such depressions are particularly painful because the person suffering not only has to deal with the pain of depression but additional shame that they associate with feeling this incapacitated. Thoughts such as, "I have no right to be depressed, I have such a good life," tend to dominate the persons thinking.  A counselor, because of the objective and supportive stance they assume in working with those struggling, may help to find the struggling person find a way to help you find a way to balance your need to employ your strength while also recognizing the those times when it's healthy to admit we could use some support.</p>

					<h2>Types Of Depression</h2>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>Different Kinds of Depression</h4>
					<p>Because the term "depression" has taken on such broad meaning in the general public, it's difficult to really describe a range of different emotional and psychological phenomena because they all involve some aspects of this thing called "depression".  While some may seem, by their description, to be less serious than others, all have the capacity to diminish life experiences.  Thus, this page is intended to help you describe your experience with depression (or that of a person you care about) as you seek the help and support you may need.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>A Major Depressive Episode</h4>
					<p>A Major Depressive Episode is described as a period of at least 2 weeks of depressed mood or a loss of pleasure or interest in the activities of life.  In order to formally diagnose a Major Depressive Episode, at least four of the symptoms associated with depression must also be present.  Several of these characteristics are described in the main Depression Page. Sometimes, however, experiencing the full range of symptoms for depression is perfectly normal.  For example, the loss of a loved one would naturally result in a person feeling so pushed down by the weight of the difficult loss that they lack interest in their normal life activities and feel overwhelming sadness.  In such a case, the experience is regarded as Bereavement and not Depression, although they may look and feel the same.  Similarly, there are times that a person experiences some of the indicators of depression in reaction to some event or situation (such as moving, a romantic break-up, surviving a traumatic accident, etc) but not enough to warrant the diagnosis of a Major Depression.  These are regarded as problems in adjustment and, while they are not the equivalent of a major depression, they can evolve into one if the person is unable to recover from the difficult adjustment period.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>Dysthymia</h4>
					<p>Sometimes, an individual seems to have been depressed for so long it almost seems normal.  The depressed mood is not accompanied by enough of the depression symptoms to meet the criteria for a Major Depression, perhaps because the depressed mood has been present for so long, the individual has learned to function enough that other symptoms do not impair functioning anymore.  When a person is suffering from this depressed mood for 2 or more years, feeling down and unmotivated toward life,  mental health professionals refer to this as Dysthymia.  In addition to the "feeling down", disrupted sleep and appetite, poor concentration, low energy or fatigue, lack of confidence or low self esteem, and feelings of hopelessness are all associated with Dysthymia.  While not all are present, if two or more of these states (in addition to the sad or down mood) are ongoing, professional intervention may be needed to help overcome the difficulty and help the person restore a more complete level of functioning with greater satisfaction about life.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>Other Depressive Disorders</h4>
					<p>In order for mental health professionals to communicate with each other in order to understand and study the different challenges they witness in people seeking help, it is necessary to classify the difficulties into diagnostic criteria (such as Major Depression, Dysthymia, etc).  However, there are times that difficulties are presented that do not completely fit the identified diagnoses.  This does not mean that the distress being experienced by people is not significant.  Therefore, if some of the descriptions of Major Depression do not seem to fit, yet the feeling is one of "being depressed" in the general public's understanding of  "feeling down and out" or heavy with sadness or emptiness still should be acknowledged and attended to.  Mental health professionals do not need a formal diagnostic criteria to recognize that someone is struggling.  Whether you or someone you care about is feeling down because of something identifiable (like a romantic break-up, failing an important class, or enduring a family crisis) or whether the depressed feeling seems to have no origin, talking to someone with expertise in the various types of depression may be helpful.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>Other Mood Difficulties Involving Depression</h4>
					<p>Mental health experts have identified other psychological difficulties involving depression.  Among the more talked about is Bipolar Disorder.  Although Bipolar Disorder falls under the more broad classification of Mood Disorder (rather than being regarded as a type of depression), depression is one component of this problem. This has been called "Manic Depression" in the public eye, but that term did not sufficiently describe the complete psychological picture.   The term "bipolar disorder" defines the essential nature of the problem in that there are two "poles" of emotional/psychological functioning involved.  Whereas depression is characterized by the one psychological state of being stuck toward the extreme of feeling down and unmotivated, bipolar disorders involve these depressive episodes and also shifts to the other extreme: elevated mood and increase energy and activity, often with significant decreases in the need for sleep.  This elevated state is termed a "manic episode" (hence the previous name, "manic depression").  Although this episode may feel positive and can involve a lot of positive productivity, these elevated moods can be quite problematic as they often involve irresponsible or risky behaviors, usually in very impulsive fashion with little judgment regarding consequences.  Examples of these behaviors would be spending beyond one's limits or unsafe sexual acting out.  Describing the specifics of different kinds of Bipolar disorders is beyond the scope of this page; however, this section is included here because some individuals who report problems with depressed mood may not realize that they are only presenting one dimension of their overall psychological problem (because often the elevated mood is not experienced as problematic).</p>
					<p>Another problem, identified as Cyclothymia, is similar to bipolar disorders except the severity of each extreme (in the depressed episode and in the manic episode) is not sufficient to meet a diagnosis of Bipolar disorder.  Nevertheless, all of the conditions that mental health professionals regard as Mood Disorders, have some component to them that involves some aspects of depression and can be very disruptive to an individual's daily living.</p>

					<h2>Treatment For Depression</h2>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>How is Depression Treated?</h4>
					<p>Mental health professionals may differ on the approaches they take in comprehending and addressing depression.  While it is beyond the scope of this page to review all of the different theories and approaches to dealing with depression, it might be helpful to have some idea of what one might expect if they seek professional help to attend to depression.</p>
					<p>It is quite likely that the mental health professional will begin by exploring if the depression is occurring in an identifiable context.  For example, has the person been depressed since the break-up of a valued romantic relationship, since coming to college, or ever since the weather turned cold and dreary.  Sometimes, the origin is in a person’s past. The death or severe illness of a loved one years before, a difficult life period of abuse or neglect in childhood,  a traumatic experience that seems to linger or periodically resurge in a person's awareness--all of these might be relevant to the way a person is experiencing the present or at least helpful in understanding the scenery of a person’s pain. Often, however, there is nothing the person can point to that would prompt them to feel as depressed as they do, and this "undefined" depression might inform how a mental health professional will proceed.</p>
					<p>Some professionals may take a more past-based approach, reviewing the person's personal and social history in order to identify and resolve some pain that has been unattended to. This approach, called a psychodynamic approach, is rooted in more traditional forms of psychological intervention and it assumes difficulties are beneath a person's awareness. The idea behind this approach is that this awareness, when brought to the surface, will bring with it some relief via a new understanding and revision of the way a person interprets his or her life (including the depression).</p>
					<p>Other professionals may take a more interpersonal approach, relying on a supportive and empathic counseling relationship to help the person feel safe enough to get through the various forms of pain contained in the depression. The client, via the relationship with the mental health professional, begins to remember how to be connected with people in a positive way that can then be applied to personal relationships outside the counseling context. The assumption in this approach is that connection, between human beings, creates a healing context , and that in healthy supportive relationships, recovery from psychological hurt simply occurs naturally in the way that a flower will naturally grow in a well tended garden.</p>
					<p>While these approaches have some significant merit, most mental health professionals recognize that integrating these perspectives into what is known as Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy is usually most appropriate. Research into different approaches usually indicates that a cognitive-behavioral approach is most effective, although the skills and personal styles of the mental health professional likely plays a very important role in how helpful any approach is.</p>
					<p>So, what exactly is the cognitive-behavioral approach? Underneath the jargon is a rather simple but stimulating idea:  how we think impacts how we feel and, in turn, how we behave. So, if we can have an impact on what we're thinking, we can have an impact on the behavioral consequences of those thoughts: namely, becoming depressed. It may sound ridiculously simple; but the very nature of depression is such that a person's normal ability to balance positive with negative thoughts is impaired.  A trained mental-health professional has skills to detect even the most subtle forms of this emphasis on negative thoughts.  Pointing these out to the client and help the client to point them out to him or her self becomes the first task. Then, gradually, counseling involves a supported effort toward identifying true and applicable alternative thoughts. Eventually, the normal balance between negative and positive thoughts return and yield a view of the world and reactions to that world that is not so. well, not so depressing.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>What About Medication?</h4>
					<p>Various medications are used in the treatment of depression and, from this medical approach which recognizes depression as an illness, medication is the most appropriate intervention. However, research does tend to suggest that medication and cognitive-behavioral therapy is more effective than medication alone.</p>
					<p>People have different attitudes toward medication, especially when it comes to addressing problems of an emotional or psychological nature. Many individuals are simply uncomfortable taking medication. Some fear it will lead to addiction.  Others feel it indicates a failure to deal with the problem through their own inner strength. Yet, others are quite comfortable and eager to take antidepressant medication because they view it as a tool, as valid as any inner-psychological resource that is available to alleviate distress. It is clear to mental health professionals that the chemistry of a person with depression is different than that of someone who is not struggling--similarly, the chemistry of a person is different when depressed than when that same person is not depressed. The often used phrase "a chemical imbalance" is used in the popular media to describe depression or other psychological difficulties. Medication simply brings about a restoration, so to speak, of that balance needed to free the struggling person from the effects of depression.</p>
