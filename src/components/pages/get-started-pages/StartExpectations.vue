           What To Expect During an Access Consultation
        </h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                For this initial visit, you will meet with a counselor for about 15 minutes, in which the counselor will
                assess any concerns about your safety, evaluate if your needs can be met within CAPSâ€™ brief treatment
                model, and determine where services are most appropriately provided; and
            </li>
            <li>
                You will leave with recommendations about next steps in your care, which may be at CAPS, another campus
                resource, or in the community. If services will be at CAPS, you will schedule future appointments with
                the same provider(s). Follow up visits at CAPS are about 45-50 minutes for Individual/Couples
                appointments and 90 minutes for Groups.

        </ol>
