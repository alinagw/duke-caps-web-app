    <h1>CAPS Pledge of Support</h1>
    <p>
      When our community is shaken by tragic or abhorrent events on campus or beyond, CAPS’ staff wants to acknowledge the impact of these events on the students we serve.  As believers in every human being’s potential for healing and growth, we hold firm to the values of inclusion, multicultural diversity and social justice. We believe in empowering all people – including those who are marginalized and oppressed – to act together to challenge injustice, to condemn discrimination, and to promote a common humanity of equitable treatment and social cooperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We seek to foster a community that is safe for all students.  Just as reactions to controversial events vary across campus, they also vary among the CAPS staff.   We are each uniquely affected and respond with an array of complex emotions and viewpoints. At the same time, we strive to understand and respect perspectives that may be different from our own. Therefore, we join voices in making this pledge to all Duke students: your perspectives, values, and experiences will be welcome at CAPS, you will be safe, you will be respected, and you will be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to remind you that you are not alone and that there are a variety of services available to support you through arduous times.  We applaud the tireless efforts of campus organizations, student groups, and committed individuals who provide spaces for discussion of all forms of inequality at our university and in our world.  We invite students to access these many resources.  We also invite you to reach out to CAPS as needed for emergency walk-in appointments, individual or group counseling, or tailored outreach programs by request.
    </p>
    <p><strong>
      As actions of hatred, threats of violence, and expressions fo disrespect continue to occur on campus (and beyond), CAPS stands by all communities that suffer from the racism, sexism, islamaphobia, and assaults on communities that reflect our sexual and gender diversity! CAPS would like to re-iterate our pledge of support to our students and the campus community.

    <h1>Confidentiality &amp; Privacy</h1>
    <p>
      We take your privacy very seriously, and our personal and professional ethics guide us in ensuring that the services you receive here remain confidential.  Information revealed in counseling, even the information that you have made an appointment, is not disclosed to others unless you provide written authorization for that information to be released.
    </p>
    <h6>The exceptions to this practice are:</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>
        When a counselor believes you present an imminent danger to yourself or others.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a counselor believes the life or safety of a readily identifiable third person is endangered.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a counselor believes that a child or vulnerable adult is being subjected to abuse, neglect, or exploitation.
      </li>
      <li>
        When disclosure is made necessary by legal proceedings.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Please note that we operate as a team when we provide services. To provide effective and up-to-date services, our individual counselors sometimes consult with with one another about our work with students. However, we all maintain the same allegiance to confidentiality described here to protect your privacy.

    <h1>Email Policies</h1>
    <p>
      No e-mail communication regarding clinical issues or appointments is permitted due to the lack of security available when communicating via e-mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Staff differ in how often they check email, and it is important that you not rely on e-mail as a means of trying to contact CAPS for counseling or consultation about mental health concerns. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We rely on more traditional ways of communicating--the telephone or stopping by in person. We hope you understand.
