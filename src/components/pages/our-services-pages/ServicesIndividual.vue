    <h1>Individual Counseling</h1>
    <p> 
      Individual counseling can help the individual student explore, understand, and work through difficulties on a one-to-one basis with a CAPS counselor. Seeking support is a sign of a resourceful student, one able to know when it's time to take action in order to move through the challenges of life here at Duke. Often, simply having an objective person with whom to discuss things brings about a fresh perspective and a renewed sense of strength and confidence. Other times, the process helps students recognize different options.
