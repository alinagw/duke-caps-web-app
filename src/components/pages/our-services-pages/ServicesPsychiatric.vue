    <h1>Psychiatric Services</h1>
    <p> 
      CAPS has three licensed, board-certified psychiatrists who have completed specialty training in psychopharmacology and psychotherapy.  CAPS psychiatrists offer limited psychotherapy, psychiatric consultation within the Duke community, medication evaluations, ongoing medication management within the scope of CAPS services, and referrals for needs that fall outside the scope of care that CAPS provides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medication management can include treatment for depression, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, eating problems, and more. We do not evaluate or treat students for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, but we can help with appropriate referral when this is a concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students commonly first meet with one of our therapists before being referred to a CAPS psychiatrist for a medication evaluation. However, students who know their needs will include consideration of medications may request that their initial visit is with one of the psychiatrists. Because we schedule a full hour for the initial medication evaluation and then always schedule half-hour follow-up visits for anyone for whom we prescribe medicine, at times there may be a wait to see a psychiatrist. However, emergency slots are available during the week for urgent medication needs.
